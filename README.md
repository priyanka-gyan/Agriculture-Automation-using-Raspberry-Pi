<h1 align="center">Agriculture-Automation-using-Raspberry-Pi</h1>
A project which provides an affordable and flexible platform for controlling and monitoring various aspects of farming operations includes Environmental Monitoring, automated irrigation system, Remote Monitoring and Control.

## Objective

As we know the agricultural sector has its largest contribution in the Indian economy. To
achieve maximum utilisation of manpower and to obtain maximum profit in a given stipulated
there is a need in the up gradation of various engineering techniques that are being used today.

## Technology used
- For the execution of the project, proteus 8 professional simulation software is mostly compatible to operate the module. Proteus
Design Suite includes comprehensive support for embedded Raspberry-Pi design. It includes both hardware and software design,
world leading system level simulation with debugging and programming of the physical hardware.

- All the required libraries needed to be installed for the working of modules that will detect and work for the system inside Proteus
simulation.
  
- Python version 3.9.6 is used to code the project modules.

## Brief explanation of work plan:

- <h3>For smart irrigation system:</h3>
If temp>25°C and moisture level <100 value then automatically motor will start rotating and if temp<25°C and moisture value>100
value then motor will stop. If rain comes which is detected by rain sensor, motor will stop rotating. The motor start and motor stop
message will display on the screen for which GSM module is being used. Similarly, to display the temperature and and moisture level
value, display module is being used.

## Working of modules

Presence of every module has been reasoned and placed carefully in order to contribute to the best working of the unit.
The system has been tested to function automatically, and to the best of its ability. The moisture sensors measure the
moisture level (water content) of the different plants. If the moisture level is found to be below the desired level, the
moisture sensor sends the signal to the operational amplifier which triggers the DC Motor pump to turn ON and supply
the water to the respective field area. When the desired moisture level is reached, the system halts on its own and the
DC Motor pump is turned OFF. Thus, the functionality of the entire system has been tested thoroughly and it is said to
function successfully. automatic systems using a Microprocessor, moisture sensor, temperature sensor and the rain
sensor and other electronic tools were developed. It was observed that the proposed methodology controls the moisture
content of the soil of cultivated land. The motor automatically starts pumping water if the soil is dry and needs water
and stops when the moisture content of the soil is maintained as required.
